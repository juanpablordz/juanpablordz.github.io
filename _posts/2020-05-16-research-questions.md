The objective for his write-up is to lay out some of the research questions and ideas that most interestes me.

**Interesting concepts**

1. Probabilistic generative models.
2. Program Induction and Program Synthesis
3. Self-Play (Active learning)
4. Goals, Plans and Stories.
5. Sleep-wake cycle in learning.
6. Transfer learning – Metaphor and analogy learning
8. Deep Learning




##### 1. Probabilistic generative models

The process of understanding "how the world works?" can be thought as the process of coming up with a good probabilistic generative model of the world. This type of models supports simulations and therefore planning.

##### 2. Program induction and program synthesis

Coming up with a probabilistic generative model that explains how the world works is a problem that concerns program synthesis. We have a data-points from the world and we have to come up with a program/model that best explains/describes these observations.

##### 3. Self-play (Active learning)

Self-play allow an agents to come up with novel strategies to address situations that are unknown to the agent's designer/creator.

##### 4. Goals, plan and stories

It seems to me that humans don't have an underlying static reward/cost function. We set goals and build stories that may have an implicit function that guides our learning/behavior. Intelligent behavior can be summed up by coming up with goals/plans/stories that lead to the agent's learning.

##### 5. Sleep-wake cycle in learning

During "sleep" phase there should be a consolidation of knowledge in our agent (model) similar to what our brains does when humans sleep.

##### 6. Transfer learning – Metaphor and analogy learning

I believe that our human ability to generalize to out of sample observations is possible because of our ability to frame the current unknown situation in terms of a known one using metaphors and analogies. The consequence is that we transfer our knowledge from a task to another through a a story.

##### 7. Deep Learning

Deep learning has proven to be a principled and scalable way to perform patter recognition. I see deep learning as our core primitive in all the different ideas mentioned above.

*This can eventually lead me to a good statement of purpose.*
