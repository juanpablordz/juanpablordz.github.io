title: "Research questions"

The objective for his write-up is to lay out some of the research questions and ideas that most interestes me.

**Interesting concepts**

1. Probabilistic generative models.
2. Program Induction and Program Synthesis
3. Self-Play (Active learning)
4. Goals, Plans and Stories.
5. Sleep-wake cycle in learning.
6. Transfer learning – Metaphor and analogy learning
8. Deep Learning (as a tool)




##### 1. Probabilistic generative models

The process of understanding "how the world works?" can be thought as the process of coming up with a good probabilistic generative model. This model supports simulations and therefore planning.

##### 2. Program induction and program synthesis

The process of coming up with a (probabilistic generative) model that explains how the world works is a process similar to that of program induction. We have a bunch of observations and we have to come up with the model that best explains/describes these observations.

##### 3. Self-play (Active learning)

Self-play is an essential component of learning in human beings. This strategy allows the agent to come up with novel strategies unknown to its designer/creator.

##### 4. Goals, plan and stories

It seems to me that we (human beings) don't have an underlying static reward/cost function. We set goals and build stories that may have an implicit function that guides our learning/behavior.

##### 5. Sleep-wake cycle in learning

During "sleep" phase there should be a consolidation of knowledge in our agent (model) similar to what our brains does when humans sleep.

*This an eventually lead me to a good statement of purpose.*
