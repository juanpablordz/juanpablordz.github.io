Welcome dear reader!

I hope you enjoy picking your brain with some of the questions the surely pick on mine.

I'm interested in the concept of intelligence. A variety of definitions and explanations have been put forward by different disciplines of Science, yet there is no consensus. I figure there must be common threads. My blog posts will address definitions, ideas, open questions, and discussions regarding intelligence from different points of view. My objective is to strive for a better understanding of the problem so that I can formulate better questions.
