Welcome dear reader!

I hope you enjoy picking your brain with some of the questions the surely pick on mine.

I'm interested in the concept of intelligence. A variety of definitions and explanations have been put forward by different disciplines of Science, yet there is no consensus. I figure there must be common threads as well as particular ones for each perspective. My blog posts will address definitions, ideas, open questions, and discussions regarding intelligence from different points of view. My objective is to strive for a better understanding of the problem's complexity, so that I can formulate good questions.
