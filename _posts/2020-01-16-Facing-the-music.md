title: "Facing the music (poem)"

You have been practicing
all this time behind the curtain.

No one has been looking.

Only the toughest of all judges and you
have been engaging in long conversations,
figuring out if you are ready.

Suddenly,
the curtains rises.

You are blinded
by an unfamiliar beam of light
that goes all the way through
to your occipital lobe.

Your pupils,
take a second to adjust.

The room,
pitch dark.

Now,
stars and spots of light
begin to appear in the room.

You shift your eyes down and
the wooden floor is gone.

You are floating.

The room resembles
a Hubble photograph.

The entire galaxy is watching,
you will finally perform.

In your head
you order your body to move,
just before your body actually makes a move,
you wake up.
