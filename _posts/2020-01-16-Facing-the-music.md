title: "Facing the music (poem)"
---

You have been practicing <br>
all this time behind the curtain.

No one has been looking.

The toughest of all judges and you,<br>
have been engaging in long conversations,<br>
trying to figure out,
if you are ready.

Suddenly,<br>
the curtains rises.

You are blinded,<br>
by an unfamiliar beam of light<br>
that goes all the way through<br>
to your occipital lobe.

Your pupils,<br>
take a second to adjust.

The room,<br>
pitch dark.

Now,<br>
stars and spots of light<br>
begin to appear in the room.

You shift your eyes down and<br>
the wooden floor is gone.

You are floating.

The room resembles<br>
a Hubble photograph.<br>


The entire galaxy is watching,<br>
you will finally perform.

In your head, <br>
you order your body to move,<br>
just before your body actually makes a move,<br>
you wake up.
