title: "Loving for a skeptic (thought)"
---
The uncertainty of this “reality” we are going through is complex as it is. There are so many unanswered questions parked in my mind and others traveling around. Knowing this, made me decided that I will take the risk of “loving” (whatever that may be). I have decided to introduce another variable to my complex universe. One that has its own uncertainty. Another perspective for my brain to account for.

This sounds completely illogical, why would some introduce more uncertainty to his own. This feeling transcends our four-dimensional reality (space-time). This feeling travels undefined into the future and ignores the time and space constraints that have been defined in our minds.

The path of searching for truth demands me to look into every possibility and explore the unknown. Today being a 20 year old, I realize that loving will contradict every rational principle humans have. Out of love, we do the most extraordinary things, and I as a skeptic must explore.
