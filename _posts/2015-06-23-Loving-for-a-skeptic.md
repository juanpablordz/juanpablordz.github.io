title: "Loving for a skeptic (thought)"
---
The uncertainty of this “reality” we are going through is complex as it is, there are so many unanswered questions parked in my mind and others traveling around. Knowing this, made me decided I will take the risk of “loving” (whatever that may be), I’ve decided that I will introduce another variable into my complex universe one that has it’s own uncertainty, introducing another perspective for my brain to account for.

This sounds completely illogical why would some introduce more uncertainty to his own. This feeling transcends our four-dimensional reality (space-time), this feeling travels undefined into the future, ignoring the time and space barriers that have been established in our minds.

The path of searching for truth demands me to look into every possibility and explore the unknown. Today being a 20 year old, I realize that loving will contradict every rational principle we humans have. Out of love, we do the most extraordinary actions, but I as a skeptic must explore this path.
